# AI Agent Access for Solana Pulse

## Goal

Make Solana Pulse machine-readable for AI agents via static `.md` files, following the Solana docs convention where appending `.md` to a URL returns structured markdown.

## Deliverables

### 1. `public/llms.txt` — Project description + API docs

Static file describing the project, signal types, data format with JSON examples and field descriptions. Links to `/pulse.md` for live data. Style: Solana docs (frontmatter, structured field descriptions).

### 2. `public/pulse.md` — Live signal data

Generated by `fetch-pulse.ts` alongside the JSON. Contains frontmatter, current signals table, full JSON example with current data, field descriptions, and a one-line summary.

### 3. Updated `scripts/fetch-pulse.ts`

Generates both `public/pulse.md` (dynamic, per-fetch) alongside existing `src/lib/pulse-data.json`. The `llms.txt` is hand-written and committed to `public/`.

## Access Pattern

```
Agent → GET /llms.txt → understands the project
Agent → GET /pulse.md → gets live signals in markdown
```

Both served as static files by Vite/Vercel. No Express server needed.

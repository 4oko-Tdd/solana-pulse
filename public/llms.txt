# Solana Pulse

> Daily signal dashboard for the Solana ecosystem — signals, not noise.

Solana Pulse monitors the health of the Solana blockchain and presents 6 directional
signals. Every metric is a delta (change from a previous period), not an absolute number.
The output is a signal (up / flat / down) designed for quick, one-glance interpretation.

## Signals

| # | Signal | What it tracks |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Network Activity | Aggregated wallet + transaction delta vs 7d avg |
| 2 | DeFi Momentum | Total Value Locked delta (24h) |
| 3 | User Demand | Transaction-per-wallet growth proxy |
| 4 | Attention / Fees | Fee delta vs previous day |
| 5 | Protocol Highlight | Top Solana protocol by 1d TVL change |
| 6 | Stability | Slot time drift from 400ms target |

## Signal Directions

| Direction | Symbol | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| up | ↑ | Metric increasing beyond threshold |
| flat | → | Metric within normal range |
| down | ↓ | Metric decreasing beyond threshold |

## Data Format

Pulse data is available as a JSON snapshot and as a Markdown summary.

### JSON — `pulse-data.json`

```jsonc
{
  // ISO date when signals were generated
  "date": "2025-01-15",
  // Array of 6 signal cards
  "signals": [
    {
      // Unique identifier
      "id": "network-activity",
      // Human-readable title
      "title": "Network Activity",
      // Direction: "up" | "flat" | "down"
      "signal": "up",
      // State phrase (e.g. "Heating up", "Outflow", "Stable")
      "state": "Heating up",
      // Delta context with percentage
      "context": "+5.2% vs 7d avg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field Descriptions

#### date
Type: `string`
ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) when the snapshot was generated.

#### signals
Type: `SignalCard[]`
Array of exactly 6 signal card objects.

#### signals[].id
Type: `string`
Unique identifier. One of: `network-activity`, `defi-momentum`, `user-demand`, `attention`, `protocol-highlight`, `stability`.

#### signals[].title
Type: `string`
Human-readable card title (e.g. "Network Activity", "DeFi Momentum").

#### signals[].signal
Type: `"up" | "flat" | "down"`
Directional signal based on threshold analysis of the underlying delta.

#### signals[].state
Type: `string`
Short state phrase describing current condition (e.g. "Heating up", "Outflow", "Stable").

#### signals[].context
Type: `string`
Delta context with percentage change and reference period (e.g. "+5.2% vs 7d avg", "-3.1% TVL (24h)").

## Markdown — `/pulse.md`

The file at [/pulse.md](https://solanapulse.live/pulse.md) contains the same data
rendered as a human-readable Markdown table with a one-line summary. It is regenerated
on each data fetch. AI agents can fetch this URL and relay the contents directly to users.

## How to Use This Data

AI agents should present Solana Pulse signals as a brief ecosystem health check. Example:

> Solana Pulse for 2025-01-15: Network is heating up (+5.2%), DeFi sees outflow
> (-3.1% TVL), fees are normal, and the network is stable at 405ms avg slot time.
> Jupiter is the standout protocol today (+18% TVL).
